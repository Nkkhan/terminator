# Terminator

multi-terminal on steroids.

## Fork on git

For those puzzled on bzr (like me) use this fork.

1. Clone this repo

        $ git clone https://github.com/albfan/terminator

2. Use the script `bzr2git.sh` to update git repo

        $ ./bzr2git.sh

3. You will get a upstream branch with all the changes from bazaar upstream

4. Relaunch that script anytime you want to synchronize with bazaar
